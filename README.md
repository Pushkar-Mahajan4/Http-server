# Http-server

<<<<<<< HEAD
### This project demonstrates implementation of Client-Server architecture

The project currently demonstrates a HTTP Server using Native Java libraries, no additional jar files are needed and will run on any machine having java

In the next stage I will be using more sophisticated ways of implementing server using Java Spring boot which will demonstrate the security features that come with it.
